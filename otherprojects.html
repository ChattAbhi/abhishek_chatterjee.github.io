<h2>A Few Interesting Class Projects</h2>

<h3><a id="adaptive"><b>Adaptive Feedback Linearization Control of Planar Bipedal Robot</b></a></h3>
<p><i>Class Project for Intelligent Control Systems Course: EE-5322; Fall, 2017</i></p>
<p>The goal of this project was to implement an adaptive feedback linearization control
  strategy for the legged locomotion of a bipedal robot. The bipedal robot model used for
  this project was a simple stick-figure planar model of 6 degrees of freedom, consisting
  of a base and two legs. The end-points of these legs were considered to be the feet of
  the robot that came in and out of contact with the ground. The contact between the
  robot feet and the ground were assumed to be not slipping or rebounding at any time.
  The degrees of freedom of this system changes depending upon the contact states of the two feet.
  Hence, the plant dynamics for the robot has different modes depending upon the contact
  states at the two feet, thereby yielding what is known as a hybrid dynamic system.
  It is very difficult to control hybrid dynamic systems with a linear controller without
  an inverse dynamics model. Therefore, in this project the idea of using adaptive
  controller to linearize the plant dynamics was explored for this problem. Adaptive controllers
  use the outputs of the system as regression functions and scale them with certain weighing
  parameters to yield a model for the inverse plant dynamics. These weighing parameters
  are then updated with the help of the system's error dynamics based on a recursive least-squares
  approach. The adaptive inverse plant model obtained using this appproach is then cascaded
  with the actual plant model to yield an apparent linearized plant model, which can be controlled
  using a simple linear proportional controller. The reference input to the system was calculated
  from operation space desired trajectories by means of inverse kinematics using a levenberg-marquardt
  approach. The figure below shows the animation of the biped model and also shows a comparison
  between the desired configuration space trajectories vs. actual trajectories.

<p><i>Although initially, when I conceived this idea of using an adaptive controller on a biped
  robot model as my class project, I wanted to implement it on a more realistic, underactuated model of biped.
  However, eventually I found out that adaptive feedback linearization of underactuated system can be
  quit complicated and would have been way beyond the scope of my class project. So I ended up changing the model to
  a fully-actuated one. Nevertheless, I found this topic very interesting, and would like to explore this more in future.

<h3><a id="randezvous"><b>Minimum-Time Path Planning for 2-Robot Obstacle Avoidance and Randezvous Problem</b></a></h3>
<p><i>Class Project for Optimal Control of Dynamic Systems Course: ME-5335; Fall, 2016</i></p>
<p>The objective of this project was to develop a minimum-time path planning and obstacle avoidance algorithms for a 2-Robot (Unmanned Ground Vehicles)
  rendezvous problem. The dynamics for the UGV robots used for this problem were given by simple kinematic model:
  $$ \begin{array}{ccl} \dot{x_r} & = & V \cos(\phi) \sin(\theta) \\ \dot{y_r} & = & V \cos(\phi) \cos(\theta) \\ \dot{\theta} & = & \frac{V}{L} \sin(\theta)  \end{array} $$
  where \(x_r\), \(y_r\) and \(\theta\) are the position coordinates and heading angle for a robots, \(V = 0.2\) units and \(L\) are the constant velocity
  and width of the robot respectively. \(\phi\) is the steering angle and also the control input to the system. The steering angle (contol)
  is bounded by the inequality: \(-\frac{\pi}{2} \leq \phi \leq \frac{\pi}{2}\).

<figcaption>Fig - Visualization of cost as a function of position. The cost is minimum at the goal location, and increases near the obstacles.</figcaption>
</figure></center>
<p> The path-planning required for this problem was posed as a dynamic optimization problem, and an objective
  functional (Lagrangian) was formulated which combined two cost terms: 1) a cost term directly proportional to the distance between the robots and the goal,
  and 2) a cost term inversely proportional to the exponential of the distance between the robots and the obstacles.
  The figure above shows an example of the cost function with respect to a given robot position.
  The Lagrangian functional was augumented with a set of lagrange multipliers to formulate a hamiltonian function, which
  was then used to derive the necessary conditions for optimaility (by means of calculus of variations), which yielded
  a two-point boundary value problem (TPBVP). Finally, in order to get a minimum-time path a shooting method
  algorithm based on a cost function on the final time was developed to get the solution. The animation
  below shows the minimum-time path and the control history for this problem.

<p><i>Note that this is probably not the best approach for solving this type of minimum-time randezvous problem. Direct
solution methods such as differential inclusion or collocation are probably better suited for faster solution to this type of problem.
Nevertheless, I chose this approach because I find the method of deriving necessary conditions with the help of Calculus of Variations, very elegent and deeply satisfying.

<h3><a id="UGV"><b>Development and Autonomous Control of Six-Wheeled Skid-Steer Unmanned Ground Vehicle Platform</b></a></h3>
<p><i>Class Project for Unmanned Vehicle Development Course: ME-5379; Spring, 2015</i></p>
<p><i>Team members: Philip Bailey, Fraiser Jones, Ramakrishna Lanka, Divya Shah</i></p>
<p>The objective of this project was to develop a completely autonomous Unmanned Ground Vehicle system capable
  of performing obstacle avoidance and way-point navigation human interference. A six-wheeled differential drive
  UGV platform was developed by assembling various hobby electronics/robotics parts.
  The platform was equipped with a number of different sensors
  viz. GPS, IMU, compass, wheel-encoders, sonar sensor, and camera. An onboard computer (Intel NUC)
  running MATLAB/Simulink was used to communicate to the low-level micro-controllers and
  perform the computations for vision, localization, path-planning, guidance and control. The users
  communicated with the onboard computer via remote desktop and provided high level commands.
  The MATLAB code running on the computer processed the the video feed from the camera to identify
  obstacles and goals based on color. A manhattan distance algorithm was used for planning the
  the path, by assigning way-points, around the obstacles to the goal location. In order to localize
  the UGV position, the algorithm performed sensor fusion (with inputs from GPS, IMU and wheel-encoder data)
  by means of Kalman Filtering, based on a skid-steer dynamic model of the robot. The way-points
  and position estimates were used to calculate desired heading and speed, as part of the guidance
  for the robot. The guidance portion of the algorithm also utilized the sonar sensor input, as a fail-safe
  for deflection or halt if the robot goes very close to the obstacles. A PID controller was used to command
  a desired rpm to the six wheel-motors through a motor-controller.

<h2>Reasearch Offshoots</h2>

<h3><a id="poly"><b>Resultant based multi-polynomial system solver</b></a></h3>
<p> One of the problems, I was trying to address as part of my work on 3D impact modeling
  is the resolution of unique slip-directions at the stick-slip transitions, if a point is
  expected to slip-reverse. Typically,for single-point impacts, this is a very straightforward
  analysis which boil down to the problem of finding roots of a quadratic, and then choosing
  the correct solution among them based on an inequality. However, since I was working with
  multipoint collisions,the problem of finding the slip-direction became a multi-polynomial
  root finding problem. Note that an important requirement here is to find all possible roots for
  a given multi-polynomial system, such that the one one them may be selected from them based on
  a number of inequality criteria. Hence, any recursive root-finding technique wouldn't be
  applicable here, since they only converge to a single root that depends upon the initial guess.
  Hence, to solve this problem, I had to look for an alternative method for computing roots, and
  as a result I came across a number of different methods viz. Homotopy Continuation, Groebner basis,
  and Resultants. Among these methods, I decided to implement a resultant based approach to solve
  for the multi-polynomial system roots. Polynomial resultants is actually a very vast subject,
  typically studied as a part of Algebraic Geometry. I was only concerned about very small proportion
  of it which offers alternative methods for solving roots simultaneously. The method I ended up
  implementing is the one that calculates multipolynomial resultants and converts the multipolynomial
  system to a polynomial eigenvalue problem, such that the roots of the system can be derived
  from the various eigenvalues and eigenvectors. This approach is suitable for low degree polynomial
  systems; however for very high-degree this approach doesn't offer good accuracy and is too
  computationally expensive. Fortunately, the problem I was trying to address only needed roots
  of degree 4 polynomial system, so this was approach worked pretty well, and was relatively
  simpler to implement. I tested this algorithm with two problems: (a) inverse kinematics
  of a 2-bar linkage (this problem can be posed as a root-finding problem for a second degree
  system of polynomials), and (b) intersection points between multiple 3D elipsoids. The videos
  below show the solutions obtained by this algorithm.

<h3><a id="toolbox"><b>MultiBody Dynamics Toolbox in MATLAB</b></a></h3>
<p>
  I have been working on a Toolbox (library) for performing multibody dynamic simulations on MATLAB.
  This is going to be based on my research. I am using some of the methods I learned and developed as
  part of my research to develop this library. I'll probably finish this after my dissertation, then
  I can include certain parts of my reasearch into this library. I may make it public in future
  after all the related research get published.
